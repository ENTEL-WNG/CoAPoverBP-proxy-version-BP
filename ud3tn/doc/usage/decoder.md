# µD3TN Data Decoder

This sub-project is designed to build a small binary that invokes µD3TN's parsers on data provided via a file and prints the decoded result. It serves multiple purposes, such as gathering information about [BPv6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5050)/[BPv7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9171/) bundles and [SSP](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e2.pdf) or [AAP](../ud3tn_aap.md) packets captured from the network, as well as performing fuzz testing on the parsers.
